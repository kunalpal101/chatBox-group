The error message is indicating that you're trying to attach the socket.io library to an Express request handler function, which is not correct. To use Express and socket.io together, you need to create an HTTP server using the http module in Node.js, and then pass that server instance to socket.io. Here's an example:

const express = require("express");
const http = require("http");
const socketIO = require("socket.io");

const app = express();
const server = http.createServer(app);
const io = socketIO(server);

io.on("connection", (socket) => {
console.log("New user connected");
});

server.listen(3000, () => {
console.log("Server running on port 3000");
});
